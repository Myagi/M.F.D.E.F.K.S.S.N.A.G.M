# MONDO FEED DELUX FOR KNOWLEDGE SHARE, SOCIAL NETOWRKING, AND GENERAL MERIMENT (M.F.D.E.F.K.S.S.N.A.G.M)

### INTRODUCTION AND GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS

Hey Lauren, welcome to the M.F.D.E.F.K.S.S.N.A.G.M team! 

problem: You see so many different types of feeds out there, maybe quite
a few made by big fancy teams in silicon valley that perfectly satisfy the spec bellow; however, 
there is not one feed created by you in this very room in Sausalito. We aim to change this and 
disrupt the BIG feed industry! 

That being said, let's start with a v. bespoke MVP for our first client that has provided the 
details of the feed of their dreams which are outlined below. 
This feed will be designed to be part of the web app of our local rock climbing gym. The app offers a way 
for their members to track their climbs / workouts, connect and track progress of other members, a message board for the gym to announce important
information to the members, upload photos of their fav routes,  and other features of the like. 
The idea behind the feed is it will be a one stop shop to see everything that is going on at the gym at any given moment.

Feed will include these post types:
* Activity of the members one has connected with (e.g. completed climbs, attended classes, etc.)
  * Grouped Activity
* Important Gym Announcements (e.g. new class offers, extended hours etc.)
* New members joining the gym 
* Person posting photos to their climb

This repo contains legacy code of previous projects and failed business ideas. Add frontend changes where you see fit.
